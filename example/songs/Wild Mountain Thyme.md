# Wild Mountain Thyme
## Irish & Scottish traditional

1. O' the `G`summer `C`time `G`has come
And the `C`trees are sweetly `G`bloomin'
And the `C`wild `G`mountain `Em`thyme
Grows `C`around the `Am`bloomin' `C`heather
Will ye `G`go `C`lassie `G`go?

> And we'll `C`all go `G`together to pull `C`wild `G`mountain `Em`thyme
All `C`around the `Am`bloomin' `C`heather, will ye `G`go `C`lassie `G`go?

2. I will build my love a bower
By yon cool crystal fountain ![thyme](thyme.png "right")
And round it I will pile
All the wild flowers o' the mountain.
Will ye go lassie go? !>

3. I will range through the wilds
And the deep glen sae dreamy
And return wi' their spoils
Tae the bower o' my dearie.
Will ye go lassie go? !>

4. If my true love she'll not come
Then I'll surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the bloomin' heather.
Will ye go lassie go? !>
